1. Use temp varibale for swapping as arithmatic operation may cause outflow of  numbers
2. Space Complexity for Selection Sort is O(1) as it does not require any extra space
3. Time Complexity for Selection Sort is O(n^2) as it has two nested loops -> n(n-1)/2
4. Small Size -> Selection Sort adopted
5. Selection Sort is not stable as it does not preserve the order of elements with same value
