1. Use temp varibale for swapping as arithmatic operation may cause outflow of  numbers
2. Space Complexity for Selection Sort is O(1) as it does not require any extra space
3. Time Complexity for Selection Sort is O(n^2) as it has two nested loops -> n(n-1)/2
4. Small Size -> Selection Sort adopted
5. Selection Sort is not stable as it does not preserve the order of elements with same value
6. Bubble Sort is stable as it preserves the order of elements with same value
7. Time Complexity for Bubble Sort is O(n^2) as it has two nested loops -> n(n-1)/2


8. Insertion Sort is stable as it preserves the order of elements with same value
9. Time Complexity for Insertion Sort is O(n^2) as it has two nested loops -> n(n-1)/2
Best Case Time Complexity for Insertion Sort is O(n) as it has one loop
Worst Case Time Complexity for Insertion Sort is O(n^2) as it has two nested loops -> n(n-1)/2

10. Insertion Sort is adaptive as it takes less time for sorted array
11. Space Complexity for Insertion Sort is O(1) as it does not require any extra space
