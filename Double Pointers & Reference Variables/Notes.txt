1. Stack & Heap Memory

2. int a[n] -> allocated by stack Memory
memory allocation happens durinf runntime if we use variable otherwise it happen during compiling time.
when the programme runs it can crash if required memory in not in stack.

3. stack - Static Memory allocation.

4. Heap - Dynamic Memory allocation.
e.g. new char
char* ch = new char;
-> pointer in stack and char in Heap
-> Total size = 8+1 = 9

5. pointer - 8 byte in 64-Bit system
-> 4 byte in 32-Bit system
