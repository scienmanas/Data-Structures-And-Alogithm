1. Linear Seach Time complexeity is O(n)
2. Binary search can be applied on monotopic function only.

Binary Search -> Time complexeity: O(logN)

To find total occurrence of a number in a sorted array by using binary search:
1. Find the first occurrence of the number
2. Find the last occurrence of the number
3. Total occurrence = last - first + 1
