1. Sieve of Eratosthenes
2. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2, effectively eliminating the non-prime numbers. The algorithm's simplicity and efficiency make it a popular choice for generating a list of primes.

However, when dealing with larger ranges, the Sieve of Eratosthenes can become memory-intensive and inefficient.

3. The segmensted sieve algorithm is an imporvement that allows you to find primes in a soecific range while using significantly less memory

4. Simple Sieve time complexeity is O(n*log(log(n)))

5. Euclid algorithm
 gcd(a,b) = gcd(a-b,b)

Time complexeity -> O(log(max(x,y)))
 
6. "Basic" arithmetic
First off, some important identities about the modulo operator:

(a mod m)+(b mod m)  mod m=a+b  mod m
(a mod m)−(b mod m)  mod m=a−b  mod m
(a mod m)⋅(b mod m)  mod m=a⋅b  mod m

7. Fast Exponentiation
